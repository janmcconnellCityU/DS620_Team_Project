    "## Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance Overview\n",
    "The **RNN baseline** was evaluated using bidirectional GRU layers to model temporal dependencies in the AudioMNIST dataset.  \n",
    "Training, validation, and test evaluations showed exceptional model stability and consistent convergence.  \n",
    "After normalization and masking of padded frames, the model achieved **99.9 % training accuracy**, **98.7 % validation accuracy**, and **99.2 % test accuracy**.  \n",
    "The accuracy and loss curves (Figures 1 and 2) confirm smooth convergence and minimal overfitting, while the confusion matrix (Figure 3) demonstrates precise classification across all ten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **training and validation accuracy** (Figure 1) exhibit rapid convergence by the second epoch, stabilizing above 0.98 for the remainder of training.  \n",
    "**Loss curves** (Figure 2) show an equally consistent decline, with validation loss stabilizing near 0.07 — clear evidence of efficient learning and generalization.  \n",
    "These outcomes indicate that the RNN captured robust temporal features without excessive parameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline RNN\n",
    "The RNN architecture comprised two bidirectional GRU layers (128 and 64 units) followed by dropout-regularized dense layers.  \n",
    "A Masking layer ensured that only meaningful audio frames contributed to training, while padded segments were ignored during backpropagation.  \n",
    "This architecture achieved high accuracy with low variance between training and validation performance, confirming that the RNN effectively learned temporal patterns inherent in spoken digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model surpassed early CNN results, which relied on 2D convolutional filters for spatial feature extraction.  \n",
    "While the CNN performed well on static spectrogram representations, it lacked the ability to model how features evolve over time.  \n",
    "In contrast, the RNN leveraged sequential context to understand both spectral and temporal relationships — a key advantage in audio classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Evaluation\n",
    "When compared to the **improved CNN** (93.8 % test accuracy), the **RNN baseline’s 99.2 %** demonstrates superior generalization and data efficiency.  \n",
    "The RNN required fewer epochs to converge and showed more stable validation behavior, while the CNN exhibited minor oscillations between training and validation accuracy.  \n",
    "Although both architectures produced strong results, the RNN’s bidirectional GRU design enabled it to process forward and backward temporal dependencies, resulting in more accurate predictions across diverse speakers and utterance styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Analysis\n",
    "Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the RNN’s learning dynamics.  \n",
    "Validation accuracy quickly approached training accuracy within the first few epochs, indicating consistent feature learning across splits.  \n",
    "The minimal gap between training and validation curves reflects effective regularization and stable gradient flow.  \n",
    "Figure 3, the confusion matrix, confirms the model’s high discriminative power — most predictions lie along the diagonal, with only minor confusion between phonetically similar digits (“eight” and “nine”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "The RNN’s strong performance is attributed to three key factors:\n",
    "- **Temporal modeling** via bidirectional GRUs captured contextual relationships that CNNs could not.  \n",
    "- **Normalization and zero-padding** with proper masking prevented bias from uneven sequence lengths.  \n",
    "- **Dropout regularization** maintained generalization without extensive data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s near-perfect accuracy and low loss suggest that the RNN learned generalized representations of digit pronunciations rather than memorizing specific examples.  \n",
    "This result aligns with established findings that recurrent architectures outperform purely convolutional models in sequential tasks where time-dependent variation matters (Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courville, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the RNN Baseline is the Best Model\n",
    "Although the **RNN baseline** and **CNN-improved** models achieved similar numerical performance, the RNN is the most appropriate final configuration for this project due to:\n",
    "1. **Superior temporal awareness:** Captures the sequence dynamics of spoken digits rather than static spatial patterns.  \n",
    "2. **Stable generalization:** Maintains consistent validation accuracy with minimal divergence from training performance.  \n",
    "3. **Simpler optimization:** Converged rapidly without advanced scheduling or augmentation.  \n",
    "4. **Efficient representation:** Achieved high accuracy using fewer trainable parameters than deeper CNN configurations.  \n",
    "5. **Deployment readiness:** Well-suited for real-time or streaming inference tasks in speech-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The **RNN baseline model** represents the optimal solution for this study, achieving state-of-the-art performance for a lightweight sequential classifier on the AudioMNIST dataset.  \n",
    "It combines temporal feature learning, efficient training convergence, and robust generalization across speakers, confirming that recurrent architectures are highly effective for compact speech recognition systems.\n",
